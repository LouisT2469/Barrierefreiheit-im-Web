# Accessibility on the web - possibilities as a user and developer

A work on the possibilities of accessibility on the Internet, which deals intensively with the realisation of an accessible website.

This website was created as part of a subject paper in computer science at a grammar school. It is the practical and personal part of my subject paper, which is the result of my work.
